Savr
====

Tired of Nat-geo photos on your Mac Screensaver ? Get Savr, and spruce up your laptop.
Savr automatticaly downloads photos from selected subreddits, and feeds them to the defaults Mac Screensaver templates.


## Installation

Either grab the bundled application [here](http://jcaille.github.io/savr), or use this project to build the app from scratch.

* You'll need a API key from [Imgur](https://api.imgur.com). Get it and replace the dumy keys in Savr_Secrets.m
* If you want to customize the default subreddits, you can do so in Savr_Utils.m

## Disclaimer

This application was written a few month ago : code is messy, implementation choices are discutable. I've been using it myself, and haven't encountered any issues, but it doesn't mean that you won't.
